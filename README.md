## Problem Statement

Atliq is a hardware manufacturing company and it sells goods to different customers such as Croma, Best Buy, Staples, Flipkart and so on. These customers sell those goods to end consumers through online (E-commerce) as well as offline stores (Brick and Mortar). While their business grows substantially across the globe, they have some bitter performance in Latin America. Even though they tried to open their stores to establish their presence there, eventually ended up with a huge loss. The major cause of this downfall because of their false intuitions based on some surveys. Previously they did all the analytical operations in Excel itself. Now they become a large firm and Excel is not going to work any more for them. To make accurate data-driven decisions, the company approached the data analytics team. As a team member, I need to do a Power BI report which helps to draw useful insights from the data.
## Theory
### Profit and Loss
-	Gross Sales: Total revenue generated by a firm from the sales of goods and/or services before any deductions.
-	Pre-invoice deductions: Yearly discount agreements are made at the beginning of each financial year with the customer before issuing an invoice. 
-	Net Invoice sales:  [Gross Sales – Pre invoice]
-	Post invoice deductions: [Promotional offers + Placement Fees + Performance Rebate]
-	Net Sales (NS): [Net Invoice – Post Invoice]
-	Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): [Manufacturing cost + Freight + Other Cost]
-	Gross Margin (GM) = [Net Sales – COGS]
-	Gross Margin %: [GM/NS]
-	Operational Costs: Expenses incurred by a business in its day-to-day costs include salaries, rent, utilities, marketing expenses, administrative costs, etc.
-	Net profit: Gross Margin – Operational Costs

### Steps followed 
-	The data can be loaded from the MySQL database. For this Power BI can be connected to the SQL database.
-	The data from the SQL database was then transformed using Power Query Editor in Power BI.
-	After transformation, the data modelling was done by creating relationships between the tables.
-	In the visualisation part, different feature views are created
